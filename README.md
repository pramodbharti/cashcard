# Cash Card API

A RESTful API for managing cash cards built with Spring Boot and Kotlin. This application demonstrates Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and implements a secure API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting cash cards.

## Features

- CRUD operations for cash cards (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Role-based access control
- User-specific data isolation (users can only access their own cards)
- Pagination and sorting for listing cash cards
- RESTful API design
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Gradle 8.x or higher
- An IDE that supports Kotlin and Spring Boot (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin 1.9.25**: Modern, concise JVM language
- **Spring Boot 3.4.5**: Framework for building production-ready applications
- **Spring Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **Spring Data JDBC**: Simplified data access layer
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development and testing
- **JUnit 5**: Testing framework
- **AssertJ**: Fluent assertions for testing
- **Jackson**: JSON serialization/deserialization

## Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

1. **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
2. **Repository Layer**: Manages data access
3. **Model Layer**: Defines the data structure

The application uses Spring Security for authentication and authorization, ensuring that users can only access their own cash cards.

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cashcard.git
   cd cashcard
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

## Usage

The application exposes a RESTful API for managing cash cards. Here are some example commands using curl:

### Get a Cash Card

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/cashcards/99 -u sarah1:abc123
```

### Create a Cash Card

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/cashcards -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"amount": 250.00}' -u sarah1:abc123
```

### Update a Cash Card

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/cashcards/99 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"amount": 300.00}' -u sarah1:abc123
```

### Delete a Cash Card

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/cashcards/99 -u sarah1:abc123
```

### Get All Cash Cards (with pagination and sorting)

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/cashcards?page=0&size=5&sort=amount,desc" -u sarah1:abc123
```

| Method | URL                   | Description                                      | Auth Required |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| GET    | /cashcards/{id}        | Get a cash card by ID                            | Yes           |
| GET    | /cashcards             | Get all cash cards (supports pagination/sorting) | Yes           |
| POST   | /cashcards             | Create a new cash card                           | Yes           |
| PUT    | /cashcards/{id}        | Update an existing cash card                     | Yes           |
| DELETE | /cashcards/{id}        | Delete a cash card                               | Yes           |

## Configuration

The application uses Spring Boot's default configuration with minimal customization:

### application.properties
```properties
spring.application.name=cashcard
```

### Database Schema (schema.sql)
```sql
CREATE TABLE cash_card
(
    ID     BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    AMOUNT NUMBER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    OWNER  VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL
);
```

## Testing

The application includes comprehensive tests:

1. **Integration Tests**: Test the entire application flow from HTTP requests to database operations
2. **JSON Tests**: Test JSON serialization and deserialization

To run the tests:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

The tests use an in-memory H2 database that is initialized with test data from `src/test/resources/data.sql`.

### Test Users

The application includes the following test users:

| Username           | Password | Role        |
|--------------------|----------|-------------|
| sarah1             | abc123   | CARD-OWNER  |
| kumar2             | xyz789   | CARD-OWNER  |
| hank-owns-no-cards | qrs456   | NON-OWNER   |
